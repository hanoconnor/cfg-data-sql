# CFG Data & SQL: Useful Resource Links Repo
<p>Useful resource links to supplement the CFG Data & SQL course. I have curated this list of useful resource links during my time as a Lead Instructor teaching the course. I decided to save the list to a repo, so students can continue to have access to them following completion of the course and for fellow CFG instructors to use.</p> 
<p>You can 'Star' to save the repo for future easy access to the resources if you have found this list useful. Please do report any broken links and I shall fix or add a suitable alternative as soon as possible.</p>
